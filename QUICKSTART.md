# pip install gymnasium

import gymnasium as gym

# Create environment
env = gym.make('CartPole-v1', render_mode='human')

# Simple random agent
observation, info = env.reset()

for _ in range(1000):
    action = env.action_space.sample()  # Random action
    observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)
    
    if terminated or truncated:
        observation, info = env.reset()

env.close()
```

    Tool(
        name="Calculator",
        func=lambda x: eval(x),
        description="Useful for math calculations"
    )
