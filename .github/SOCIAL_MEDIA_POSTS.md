**Title:** [Project] Comprehensive Open-Source Resource for Agentic AI Engineering

**Body:**
```
Hi r/MachineLearning!

I've created a comprehensive, curated repository for anyone interested in learning about or building autonomous AI agents.

**Repository:** https://github.com/VenkataAnilKumar/Agentic-AI-Engineer

## What is it?

A structured collection of free and open-source resources covering all aspects of Agentic AI Engineering - from theoretical foundations to production deployment.

## What's included?

**📚 Core Topics:**
- Autonomy & Agency
- Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning, PPO, SAC, etc.)
- Multi-Agent Systems & Coordination
- Decision Making & Planning (STRIPS, PDDL, MDPs)
- Reasoning & Problem Solving
- Safety & Ethics

**🛠️ Practical Resources:**
- 50+ Free Courses (with learning paths for beginners to advanced)
- 100+ Open Source Projects (LangChain, AutoGPT, Stable Baselines3, etc.)
- Simulation Environments (Gym, Unity ML-Agents, PyBullet, CARLA)
- Agent Architectures (BDI, Reactive, Hybrid patterns)
- Integration & Deployment guides

**💻 Code Examples:**
- Working implementations in Python
- Q-Learning, Policy Gradients, Actor-Critic algorithms
- Multi-agent coordination examples
- Safety-critical system patterns

## Who is it for?

- Students learning AI fundamentals
- Developers building autonomous systems
- Researchers exploring new techniques
- Anyone interested in LLM agents, robotics, or game AI

## Why I created this:

I noticed there wasn't a comprehensive, organized resource for Agentic AI that:
1. Focuses only on free/open-source materials
2. Covers the full spectrum (theory → practice → production)
3. Organizes by topics rather than skill levels
4. Includes both classical AI and modern LLM-based approaches

## Contributions Welcome!

This is a community project. If you know great resources, have suggestions, or want to contribute content, please check out the CONTRIBUTING.md file.

**License:** MIT (completely open and free to use)

I'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions for improvement!

# Building Autonomous AI Agents: A Comprehensive Open-Source Guide

Have you ever wanted to build AI agents like AutoGPT or create your own autonomous systems? I've compiled everything you need in one comprehensive, open-source repository.

## 🎯 What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to autonomous systems that can:
- Make decisions independently
- Plan and execute complex tasks
- Learn from interactions
- Coordinate with other agents
- Adapt to changing environments

Think: AutoGPT, autonomous vehicles, game AI, robotics systems, and multi-agent simulations.
