# 🤝 Multi-Agent Systems

## 📋 Overview

Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) involve multiple autonomous agents operating in a shared environment, requiring coordination, communication, and collaboration to achieve individual and collective goals. This section explores the architectures, protocols, and frameworks that enable effective multi-agent coordination.

## 🎯 Core Concepts

### Multi-Agent Systems
- **Definition**: Systems composed of multiple autonomous agents that interact to solve problems
- **Characteristics**: Distributed control, local information, asynchronous execution
- **Benefits**: Scalability, robustness, parallelism, modularity

### Agent Interactions
- **Cooperation**: Agents work together toward common goals
- **Competition**: Agents compete for limited resources
- **Coordination**: Agents synchronize actions to avoid conflicts
- **Negotiation**: Agents bargain to reach agreements

        # Request votes from other nodes
        self.request_votes()
    
    def request_votes(self):
        # Send vote requests to other nodes
        # In real implementation, this would be network calls
