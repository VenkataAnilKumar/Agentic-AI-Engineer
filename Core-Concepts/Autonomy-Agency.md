# 🤖 Autonomy & Agency

## 📋 Overview

Autonomy and agency form the foundational concepts of agentic AI systems. This section explores how AI systems can operate independently, make decisions without constant human intervention, and exhibit goal-directed behavior.

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### Autonomy
- **Definition**: The ability of a system to operate independently without external control
- **Levels**: From reactive responses to full cognitive autonomy
- **Characteristics**: Self-governance, independence, self-determination

### Agency
- **Definition**: The capacity to act in an environment to achieve goals
- **Components**: Perception, reasoning, action
- **Types**: Rational agents, learning agents, reactive agents

## 🏗️ Agent Architectures

| Architecture Type | Description | Use Cases | Pros | Cons |
|------------------|-------------|-----------|------|------|
| **Reactive** | Direct stimulus-response mapping | Real-time systems, robotics | Fast response, simple | Limited reasoning |
| **Deliberative** | Planning-based decision making | Complex problem solving | Strategic thinking | Computationally expensive |
| **Hybrid** | Combines reactive and deliberative | Autonomous vehicles, games | Balanced approach | Complex to design |
| **BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention)** | Mental state-based reasoning | Cognitive agents | Human-like reasoning | Complex implementation |

## 📚 Core Principles

### 1. Goal-Oriented Behavior

    A[Goal Definition] --> B[Environment Perception]
    B --> C[Action Planning]
    C --> D[Action Execution]
    D --> E[Outcome Evaluation]
    E --> F{Goal Achieved?}
    F -->|No| B
    F -->|Yes| G[Success]
```

### 2. Autonomy Levels
- **Level 0**: No autonomy (human-controlled)
- **Level 1**: Assistance (human-guided with automated features)
- **Level 2**: Partial autonomy (automated with human oversight)
- **Level 3**: Conditional autonomy (system handles most tasks)
- **Level 4**: High autonomy (minimal human intervention)
- **Level 5**: Full autonomy (no human intervention required)

### 3. Agency Components
- **Sensors**: Perception of environment
- **Actuators**: Interaction with environment
- **Reasoning Engine**: Decision-making processes
- **Knowledge Base**: Stored information and experiences
- **Goals**: Desired outcomes and objectives

## 🧪 Hands-On Examples

### Simple Reactive Agent (Python)
```python
class ReactiveAgent:
    def __init__(self, goal):
        self.goal = goal
        self.rules = {}
    
    def perceive(self, environment):
        return environment.get_state()
    
    def decide(self, percept):
        for condition, action in self.rules.items():
            if condition(percept):
                return action
        return None
    
    def act(self, action, environment):
        if action:
            environment.execute(action)

# Example usage
agent = ReactiveAgent("reach_target")
agent.rules[lambda x: x['target_visible']] = "move_to_target"
```

### BDI Agent Pseudocode
```python
class BDIAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.beliefs = {}
        self.desires = []
        self.intentions = []
    
    def update_beliefs(self, percepts):
        # Update internal world model
        pass
    
    def generate_options(self):
        # Generate possible actions based on desires
        pass
    
    def deliberate(self, options):
        # Choose intentions from options
        pass
    
    def execute_intentions(self):
        # Act on chosen intentions
        pass
```
