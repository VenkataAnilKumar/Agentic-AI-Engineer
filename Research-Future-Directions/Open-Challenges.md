## üìã Overview

Despite significant progress, Agentic AI faces fundamental challenges across technical, theoretical, and practical dimensions. This guide explores unsolved problems and research opportunities.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Challenges

### 1. Long-Horizon Planning

**Problem**: Agents struggle with tasks requiring planning over extended time horizons.

**Current Limitations**:
- Exponential growth of state-action space
- Credit assignment over long delays
- Compounding uncertainty

```python
# Challenge: Plan 1000 steps ahead
class LongHorizonPlanner:
    def plan(self, initial_state, goal, horizon=1000):
        """
        Challenge: How to plan efficiently over long horizons?
        
        Problems:
        - State space grows exponentially
        - Distant rewards are hard to credit
        - Environment changes over time
        """
        # Current approaches struggle here
        plan = []
        
        # Hierarchical planning helps but insufficient
        for t in range(horizon):
            # Branching factor ^ horizon is intractable
            action = self.select_action(state, goal, remaining_steps=horizon-t)
            plan.append(action)
        
        return plan
```

**Research Directions**:

**Current State**:
- DQN: ~200M frames for Atari games
- Humans: Learn in minutes
- Gap: 1000x difference

```python
# Measuring sample efficiency
class SampleEfficiencyBenchmark:
    def compare_to_human(self, agent, task):
        """
        Challenge: Match human sample efficiency
        
        Human: 100-1000 samples
        Current agents: 1M-100M samples
        """
        human_samples = 500
        agent_samples = 0
        
        while not agent.has_mastered(task):
            agent.train_step(task)
            agent_samples += 1
        
        efficiency_gap = agent_samples / human_samples

        """
        Challenge: Generalize to unseen scenarios
        
        Problems:

        - Brittle to distribution shift
        """
        # Train on levels 1-100
        train_performance = self.evaluate(levels=range(1, 101))  # 95%
        
        # Test on levels 101-200
        test_performance = self.evaluate(levels=range(101, 201))  # 30%

        - Action space: O(A^n)
        - Communication: O(n^2)
        """
        state_space_size = self.state_dim ** num_agents
        action_space_size = self.action_dim ** num_agents
        communication_pairs = num_agents * (num_agents - 1)
        
        return {
            'state_space': state_space_size,
            'action_space': action_space_size,
